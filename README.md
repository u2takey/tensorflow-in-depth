# tensorflow-in-depth
和 [awesome-tensorflow](https://github.com/jtoy/awesome-tensorflow) 不同, [tensorflow-in-depth](https://github.com/u2takey/tensorflow-in-depth) 偏向于收集那些关注`tensorflow`以及类似的机器学习/深度学习框架底层实现原理、架构的资料，而不是关注`如何使用`的资料。

## Papers

* [TensorFlow: Large-Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Distributed Systems](http://download.tensorflow.org/paper/whitepaper2015.pdf) - This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google
* [TF.Learn: TensorFlow's High-level Module for Distributed Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04251)
